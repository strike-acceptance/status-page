The Strike Acceptance Development Team is excited to announce the launch of our
new website and dealer portal! Prior to this, our website was just a static
website, but we have rebuilt it from the ground up to include a portal for our
partnered dealerships.

Initially, we are offering eSign, payoff, and real-time status update
functionality within our portal, but keep checking back for any major
announcements.
